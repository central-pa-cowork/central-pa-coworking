## Validating the geoJSON

When you submit a pull request, it will automatically check to ensure your geoJSON is valid.

If you'd like to check yourself, you can run `./script/cibuild` locally, or pasting the contents of `bars.geojson` into http://geojsonlint.com.

## How to find the lat/long of a location
